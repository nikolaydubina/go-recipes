        example_output: |
          For additional test cases, consider adding tests for negative float values, positive and negative infinity, unsigned
          integers, zero divided by a number greater than zero, and division with only zeros.                       
          ------------------
            Test cases:                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
            • Test for unmarshalling JSON into Decimal                                                                          
            • Test for marshalling Decimal to JSON                                                                              
            • Test for multiplication with zero                                                                                 
            • Test for multiplication identity                                                                                  
            • Test for division with zero                                                                                       
            • Test for all comparison operations for the Decimal struct.                                                        
          ------------------
          Missing test cases for the  fpdecimal  Go program include those for testing the  DivMod  and  FromString  functions.
          Additionally, there should be tests checking that zero division is not allowed, and tests that ensure the           
          FractionDigits  value does not change during the program's runtime. Important test cases include comparing decimals 
          for equality, as well as testing the commutativity, associativity, and identity properties of addition and          
          multiplication. Finally, the program should have a test that verifies the  MarshalJSON  and  UnmarshalJSON          
          functions.
      - title: Time complexity estimate
        name: charmbracelet/mods
        url: https://github.com/charmbracelet/mods
        description: This is one of recommended use cases by OpenAI website. It can produce fairly good estimations. However, in its direct form usefulness is questionable, since complex cases are not handled precisely enough, educational potential is limited, and simple cases do not require this. Perhaps, this will be utilized in future work on using models in compiler and programming. Copy function and pipe it to model with prompt asking for time complexity estimation. Below is an example.
        commands:
          - pbpaste | mods -f "calculate time complexity of following Go code function." | glow
        example_content_ext: go
        example_content: |
          func AppendFixedPointDecimal(b []byte, v int64, p int) []byte {
            if v == 0 {
              return append(b, '0')
            }

            if p == 0 {
              return strconv.AppendInt(b, v, 10)
            }

            if v < 0 {
              v = -v
              b = append(b, '-')
            }

            s := len(b)
            b = strconv.AppendInt(b, v, 10)

            if len(b)-s > p {
              i := len(b) - p
              b = append(b, 0)
              copy(b[i+1:], b[i:])
              b[i] = '.'
            } else {
              i := 2 + p - (len(b) - s)
              for j := 0; j < i; j++ {
                b = append(b, 0)
              }
              copy(b[s+i:], b[s:])
              copy(b[s:], []byte(zeroPrefix[:i]))
            }

            return b
          }
        example_output: |
          The time complexity of the AppendFixedPointDecimal function is O(N), where N is the length of the input byte slice  
          b. This is because the function performs a constant number of operations for each byte in b, and the largest        
          operation within the function is the loop that appends zeros to the byte slice, which has a length proportional to  
          the input. Other operations, such as integer conversions and comparisons, are considered constant time since the    
          input size is fixed.                 
          ------------------
          The time complexity of the function depends on the input values  v  and  p .    
          • The first three if statements before the main computation take constant time, 
          so they don't contribute to the overall time complexity.                        
          • The  strconv.AppendInt  function used twice has a time complexity of          
          O(log(v)), where v is the integer being converted to a string representation in 
          base 10.                                                                        
          • The condition  len(b)-s > p  has a constant time complexity.                  
          • The  append  and  copy  operations inside the if and else blocks take linear  
          time proportional to  p .                                                       
          • The  for  loop has a constant number of iterations, specifically 2 +  p  - (  
          len(b)-s ). The  append  and  copy  operations inside the loop also take linear 
          time proportional to  p .                                                       
          Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(log(v) + p).

        description: Mutation testing is a technique used to assess the quality and coverage of test suites. It involves introducing controlled changes to the code base, simulating common programming mistakes. These changes are, then, put to test against the test suites. A failing test suite is a good sign. It indicates that the tests are identifying mutations in the code—it "killed the mutant". If all tests pass, we have a surviving mutant. This highlights an area with weak coverage. It is an opportunity for improvement.

        commands:
          - 1. store a `pprof` CPU profile with filename default.pgo in the main package directory of the profiled binary
          - 2. build with `go build -pgo=auto``, which will pick up `default.pgo` files automatically.
      - title: Manually disable or enable `cgo`
        description: Disable `cgo` with `CGO_ENABLED=0` and enable with `CGO_ENABLED=1`. If you don't, `cgo` may end-up being enabled or code dynamically linked if, for example, you use some `net` or `os` packages. You may want to disable `cgo` to improve performance, since compiler and runtime would have easier job optimizing code. This also should reduce your image size, as you can have alpine image with less shared libraries.

        description: Capslock is a capability analysis CLI for Go packages that informs users of which privileged operations a given package can access. This works by classifying the capabilities of Go packages by following transitive calls to privileged standard library operations. The recent increase in supply chain attacks targeting open source software has highlighted that third party dependencies should not be inherently trusted. Capabilities indicate what permissions a package has access to, and can be used in conjunction with other security signals to indicate which code requires additional scrutiny before it can be considered trusted.

        description: Taint analysis is a technique for identifying the flow of sensitive data through a program. It can be used to identify potential security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, by understanding how this data is used and transformed as it flows through the code. This package provides tools to performs such analysis. Included tool is performing SQL injection taint analysis.

      - title: Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity
        description: Cyclomatic complexity is a code quality metric which can be used to identify code that needs refactoring. It measures the number of linearly independent paths through a function's source code. For example, excessive usage of nested `if` and `for` leads to increased cyclomatic complexity. This tool can report `top-N` and `over`, which makes it suitable for CI as a linter and manual investigation.
