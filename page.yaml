        description: Concatenate two files and ask to recommend missing test cases. It is not precise, has high false positive and high false negative rate. Often can not detect that tests cases are present at all. However, it can give a fresh perspective on your code. Best results are produced when asking succinct short replies. Example outputs bellow.

          - cat fpdecimal.go fpdecimal_test.go | head -c 4000 | mods -f "investigate supplied Go program and associated test suite. recommend missing test cases." | glow
        example_output: |
          For additional test cases, consider adding tests for negative float values, positive and negative infinity, unsigned
          integers, zero divided by a number greater than zero, and division with only zeros.                       
          ------------------
            Test cases:                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
            • Test for unmarshalling JSON into Decimal                                                                          
            • Test for marshalling Decimal to JSON                                                                              
            • Test for multiplication with zero                                                                                 
            • Test for multiplication identity                                                                                  
            • Test for division with zero                                                                                       
            • Test for all comparison operations for the Decimal struct.                                                        
          ------------------
          Missing test cases for the  fpdecimal  Go program include those for testing the  DivMod  and  FromString  functions.
          Additionally, there should be tests checking that zero division is not allowed, and tests that ensure the           
          FractionDigits  value does not change during the program's runtime. Important test cases include comparing decimals 
          for equality, as well as testing the commutativity, associativity, and identity properties of addition and          
          multiplication. Finally, the program should have a test that verifies the  MarshalJSON  and  UnmarshalJSON          
          functions.
      - title: Time complexity estimate
        url: https://github.com/charmbracelet/mods
        description: This is one of recommended use cases by OpenAI website. It can produce fairly good estimations. Copy function and pipe it to model with prompt asking for time complexity estimation.
        commands:
          - pbpaste | mods -f "calculate time complexity of following Go code function." | glow
        example_output: |
          The time complexity of the AppendFixedPointDecimal function is O(N), where N is the length of the input byte slice  
          b. This is because the function performs a constant number of operations for each byte in b, and the largest        
          operation within the function is the loop that appends zeros to the byte slice, which has a length proportional to  
          the input. Other operations, such as integer conversions and comparisons, are considered constant time since the    
          input size is fixed.

        description: Mutation testing is a technique used to assess the quality and coverage of test suites. It involves introducing controlled changes to the code base, simulating common programming mistakes. These changes are, then, put to test against the test suites. A failing test suite is a good sign. It indicates that the tests are identifying mutations in the code—it "killed the mutant". If all tests pass, we have a surviving mutant. This highlights an area with weak coverage. It is an opportunity for improvement.

You distributed tracing storage, search, UI, exploration, dashboards, alarms — all will automatically become test status collection. If you run integration tests in your CI, then it is particularly handy to investigate your integration tests same way as real requests, such as Go processes, databases, etc. However, if you do not have distributed traces, it is still useful for adhoc investigations. This tool processes STDOUT of `go test`. No automatic instrumentation is done.

        description: Disable `cgo` with `CGO_ENABLED=0` and enable with `CGO_ENABLED=1`. If you don't, `cgo` may end-up being enabled or code dynamically linked if, for example, you use some `net` or `os` packages. You may want to disable `cgo` to improve performance, since complier and runtime would have easier job optimizing code. This also should reduce your image size, as you can have alpine image with less shared libraries.

Running benchmarks can be in GitHub Actions or locally, storage can be in same repository `master` or dedicated branch, or standalone servers. It should be straightforward to setup this manually. Example of GitHub Action [spec](https://github.com/swaggest/rest/blob/master/.github/workflows/bench.yml) and [blog](https://dev.to/vearutop/continuous-benchmarking-with-go-and-github-actions-41ok) from [@vearutop](https://github.com/vearutop), and an example on how it produces a PR [comment](https://github.com/swaggest/rest/pull/88#issuecomment-1271540878).

        description: Cyclomatic complexity is a code quality metric which can be used to identify code that needs refactoring. It measures the number of linearly independent paths through a function's source code. For example, excessive usage of nested `if` and `for` leads to increased cyclomatic complexity. This tool can report `top-N` and `over`, which makes it suitable for CI as a linter and manual investigation.

      - title: Perform Taint Analysis
        description: Taint analysis is a technique for identifying the flow of sensitive data through a program. It can be used to identify potential security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, by understanding how this data is used and transformed as it flows through the code. This package provides tools to performs such analysis. Included tool is performing SQL injection taint analysis.
