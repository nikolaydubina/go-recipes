      - title: Make treemap of code coverage
        description: Visualize distribution of code coverage in your project. This helps to identify code areas with high and low coverage. Useful when you have large project with lots of files and packages. This 2D image-hash of your project should be more representative than a single number. Also available at https://go-cover-treemap.io.

      - title: Get delta between two benchmarks with `benchstat`
        description: This is standard way to compare two benchmark outputs. Names of bencharks should be the same. Generate benchmarks as per usual. You would get multiple tables per dimension. If no output, then pass `-split="XYZ"`. If you do not see `delta`, then pass `-count=2` or more in benchmark generation. It is recommended to have alternative implementations in different packages, to keep benchmark names the same.

        commands:
          - benchstat -split="XYZ" old.txt new.txt

      - title: Continious benchmarking
        description: It is useful to see how benchmarks change in codebase over time. This is accomplished by running benchmarks for git commits, storing results, and visualizing difference. Running benchmarks can be in GitHub Actions or locally, storage can be in same repository `master` or dedicated branch, or standalone servers. It should be straighforward to setup this manually. Example of GitHub Action [spec](https://github.com/swaggest/rest/blob/master/.github/workflows/bench.yml) and [blog](https://dev.to/vearutop/continuous-benchmarking-with-go-and-github-actions-41ok) from [@vearutop](https://github.com/vearutop), and an example on how it produces a PR [comment](https://github.com/swaggest/rest/pull/88#issuecomment-1271540878).
